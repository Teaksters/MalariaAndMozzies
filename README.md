## Testing
If you want to run a visualized simulation that is possible. To start a visualized run,
give the following instruction in your terminal:
```
python3 malaria_visualize.py
```
This will be a basic simulation with no extra options built in.

If you want to know more about the population data e.g. Immunity rate, the amount of infections etc. You can run a simulation with this data plotted in the end.
This can be done by entering the following command:
```
python3 malaria_skeleton.py
```
## Working with the experimenter

to make the experimenting with several starting points, width, depth and population values easier.
There are variables at the top of the Model() initializing function that can be adjusted according to your liking.
You can find this object in the 'malaria_skeleton.py' file.
